I am generally interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and other connected areas of computer science.
My recent contributes are related to both the application of 
Deep Learning models  to sequence and video analysis, regarding Computer Vision tasks, and fundational studies regarding novel learning algorithms and neural models.
Moreover, my interests include models suited to structured  data (Graph Neural Networks).
